### Tasks performed within a workspace 

For machine learning teams, the workspace is a place to organize their work. Some of the tasks you can start from a workspace include: 

- **Create `Jobs`**: Jobs are training runs you use to build your models. You can group jobs into `experiments` to compare metrics. 
- **Author `Pipelines`**: Pipelines are reusuable workflows for training and retrainig the model.
- **Register `Data Assets`**: Data assets aid in management of the data you use for model training and pipeline creation.
- **Register `Models`**: Once you have a model you want to deploy, you create a registered model. 
- **Create online `Endpoints`**: Use a registered model and a scoring scripts to create an online endpoint. 

Besides grouping your machine learning results, workspaces also host resource configurations: 
- `Compute targets` are used to run your experiments.
- `Datastores` define how you and others can connect to data sources when using data assets.
- `Security settings` cover networking, identity and access control, and encryption settings.
